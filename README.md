# 3dwrx-Samsung-Socket-Mount

## The purpose of 3dwrx-Samsung-Socket-Mount
The idea behind this design lies in situation that I believe many of us has experienced. While traveling I often experience a situation where I don't have socket to power my digital equipment. When there is a socket, it is directly next to the entrance of the hotel room and it is not what the traveler will demand especially nowadays when one person has much more gadgets than years ago.
To overcome this issue, I have made this design and I made my life much easier. 
With this design you can make a spot for your mobile at each socket without any problem.
