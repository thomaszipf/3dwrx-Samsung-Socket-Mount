**Why this design?**

While traveling I often encounter the situation, that there is no socket to power your equipment. Very often there is a socket directly next to the entrance of the hotel room e.g. for fast cleaning while hotels miss to orientate on the demand of the traveler that, nowadays has much more gadgets than years ago. So, I decided to create this thing to overcome this issue by making a spot for your mobile at each socket.
